I am currently working as a data analyst, however I am a beginner when it comes to pandas/R/SQL/anything related to big data.

Considering the pandemic caused a global supply chain shortage, I became interested in this subject and I decided to crawl as much information as possible,
while also developing tools to make my life easier.

Besides ESG, my other interest is ESG. I believe that we will see a major shift in how companies are valued/treated based solely on their suppliers diversity, as well as their (and their supplier) ESG scoring.
